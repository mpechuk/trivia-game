# Trivia Game

A config-driven online trivia game — play solo or host a live multiplayer quiz where
friends join from their phones. Live at **https://mpechuk.github.io/trivia-game/**

Everything about a game — questions, categories, difficulty, colors, fonts, answer-button
palette, sounds, timing, scoring — is driven by a single JSON configuration file
(see [`data/fifa_world_cup_2026_trivia.json`](data/fifa_world_cup_2026_trivia.json)).

## How to play

### Solo
**Play solo** → pick length, difficulty mix, categories, timer → answer on the same screen.

### Multiplayer
1. **Host multiplayer** on a big screen (TV/laptop). Configure the game and create a room.
2. Players open the site on their phones and **Join a game** with the room code — or scan
   the QR code in the lobby. Each player picks a name and an avatar (emoji or a generated
   [DiceBear](https://www.dicebear.com/) avatar).
3. The host screen shows the question, the multiple-choice answers, and the standings.
   Player phones show only big colored answer buttons (with the answer text repeated small).
4. When the countdown ends (or everyone answered), the correct answer is revealed and the
   avatars advance in the virtual **run** toward the finish flag. Podium + confetti at the end.

Multiplayer is fully serverless: browsers talk directly to the host tab over WebRTC
([PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/)); only the initial handshake uses the free PeerJS cloud broker.
The host tab must stay open — it *is* the game server.

### Scoring (the "run")
- **Correct**: `(base_points + speed_bonus) × difficulty_multiplier` — answering faster and
  taking harder questions moves you further.
- **Wrong**: a penalty scaled by how *fast* you answered — reckless guessing moves you
  **backwards** (a last-second wrong guess costs ~0).
- **No answer**: 0. Scores never drop below 0. With no time limit, speed bonuses and
  penalties are disabled.

All numbers are configurable (`game_defaults.scoring`, plus an "Advanced scoring" panel in setup).

## Make your own quiz

Create a JSON file with the same shape and load it via `?config=`:

```
https://mpechuk.github.io/trivia-game/?config=data/my_quiz.json
```

Minimal question shape (4 `wrong_answers` recommended; 1–4 supported):

```json
{
  "title": "My Quiz",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "category": "Science",
      "difficulty": 1,
      "question": "…?",
      "answer": "Right answer",
      "wrong_answers": ["No", "Nope", "Nah", "Never"],
      "photo_link": "https://… (optional)",
      "answer_photo": null
    }
  ]
}
```

Two optional blocks drive look & behavior (all fields have defaults; see the FIFA file for a
complete example):

- **`theme`** — `emoji` (page icon), `font_family`, `colors` (background/gradient, surface,
  text, primary, accent, correct, wrong, timer), `answer_buttons` (per-button `color` +
  `shape` glyph), `background_image`, and `sounds` (enable/volume, or per-sound URL
  overrides: `tick`, `tick_urgent`, `correct`, `wrong`, `reveal`, `advance`, `join`, `fanfare`).
- **`game_defaults`** — `question_count`, `time_per_question_seconds` (`null` = no limit),
  `choices_per_question` (2–5), `difficulty_mix` (`balanced` | `easy_ride` | `hardcore` |
  `custom`), `categories`, `question_order` (`ramp` | `shuffled`), `scoring`
  (`base_points`, `max_speed_bonus`, `difficulty_multiplier` per level, `wrong_penalty_max`,
  `min_score`), and `network.peer_config`.

`network.peer_config` accepts PeerJS options (`host`, `port`, `path`, `secure`, `key`,
`config.iceServers`) to use a self-hosted [PeerServer](https://github.com/peers/peerjs-server)
or a TURN server — useful behind strict corporate NATs, where the default STUN-only setup
may not connect.

## Development

Plain static files — no build step (GitHub Pages deploys the repo root as-is):

```
python3 -m http.server 8080     # then open http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

To test multiplayer locally without the PeerJS cloud, run `npx peerjs --port 9100` and point
`game_defaults.network.peer_config` at `{"host":"127.0.0.1","port":9100,"path":"/","secure":false}`.

Notes:
- All asset URLs are relative, so the app works from a subpath (Pages, PR previews).
- The deploy workflow uses `keep_files: true` — renamed/deleted files linger on
  `gh-pages`; prefer stable file names.
